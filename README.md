This project has been validated against the simplest test model and appears to be working for "general" systems now.
The job submission scripts, job.pbs and submit-twoLevel.sh, are made specifically for CCAST (NDSU's in-house computer cluster) and NERSC respectively.
patchLog.txt contains the patch information.
You will need to be able to run VASP for any of this code to do anything.
The contents of the directory AuxilliaryScripts are for submitting batches of jobs as well as plotting the results of those batches.
Sorry for such a short and shitty readme file. It will be updated eventually, but at least the code is publically available now :)
This code is not yet in a user-friendly state, so PLEASE contact me at landon.w.johnson@ndsu.edu if you want to get it up and running.
